# OnlyFunds
A NEARcon 2022 Project

## Judging Info

### Track

Governance – decentralizing NEAR protocol; making DAO useful in real world
Web2 to Web3 – bootstrapping “traditional” apps and tools on blockchain
Future of finance – DeFi apps and features

### Bounties

#### Covalent

We used the Covalent API to read on-chain data into our front-end.

# OnlyFunds Info    

## OnlyFunds App 

### What our App Does
Our crowdfunding platform gives backers the power of DAO governance to control the release of funds raised and hold the founding team accountable. A vote at each milestone either releases the remaining funds or returns them to the backers.

## OnlyFunds Background 
 
### Inspiration
In the web2 crowdfunding model backers have no mechanism to influence the development of the project, such as when the founding team disappears or creates something very different from what was promised.

### How we built it
We used React, Firestore, and Solidity as our backbone. We added custom functionality on top of the ERC-20 standard that gives backers DAO-based governance control over the release of the funds raised through a voting mechanism.

### Challenges we ran into
Deciding the scope of the backers' control was a challenging design space because of the many options that exist between donation and investment. We would love to talk to more founders to learn whether they would prefer to have the governance tokens persist, end, or have the option to choose.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we have an MVP on-chain and working front- and back-ends, especially considering that we didn't know each other before Sunday!

### What we learned
We learned how to use **Aurora** to compile Solidity for NEAR, how to use **Covalent** to read on-chain data, and many of our team members learned how to utilize new languages from each other.

## OnlyFunds Project

## The Team

The OnlyFunds hack team was assembled for NEARcon 2022.  We are from California, Colorado, Germany and Spain.  Most of us did not know each other before the conference and only came together to hack at this event.  With exception of one team member, none of us have participated in a hackathon before.

## What's next for OnlyFunds
- Project our burn rate based on initial protocol revenue.
- Better UI/UX for project tracking and voting.
- Research parameters founders want in the fundraising contract.
- Move back-end to IPFS.
- Make smart contracts gas-efficient and upgradable.
- Hire a designer :)











# Developer Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
